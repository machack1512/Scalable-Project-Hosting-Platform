# Scalable Project Hosting Platform

## 🚀 Description

The **Scalable Project Hosting Platform** is a cutting-edge solution for hosting and managing multiple student or team projects using Docker containers. Designed to handle web applications, databases, and services, this platform offers dynamic scaling and robust infrastructure. With the power of **Docker Swarm**, automated deployment scripts, and **Apache JMeter** for load testing, it ensures your projects are scalable, secure, and easily manageable.

### 🌟 Key Features:

- **Dynamic Scaling:** Automatically scale containers based on traffic demand using Docker Swarm.
- **Automated Deployment:** Deploy web apps and services effortlessly using bash scripts.
- **Multiple Projects Hosting:** Host different student or team projects in isolated Docker containers.
- **Load Testing Integration:** Simulate traffic and analyze scalability with Apache JMeter.
- **Modular Setup:** Add or remove services and applications easily with Docker Compose.
- **Customizable:** Support for various apps including static sites (Apache), Python (Flask), and JavaScript (Node.js) apps.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose, Docker Swarm
- **Virtualization:** Virtual Machines (AWS, Azure, or local solutions)
- **Web Servers:** Apache (for static sites)
- **Web Frameworks:** Flask (Python), Node.js (JavaScript)
- **Load Testing:** Apache JMeter
- **Automation:** Bash Scripts
- **CI/CD:** GitLab CI (optional)
- **Monitoring:** Docker Stats & Logs

## 💻 Installation

### 🧰 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **Docker Compose**: For managing multi-container applications.
- **Virtual Machines**: For isolating projects (cloud or local VMs).
- **Apache JMeter**: For load testing.
- **Bash**: For automating deployment.

### 🏗️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/scalable-project-hosting.git
   cd scalable-project-hosting
   ```

2. **Install Docker & Docker Compose:**
   - Follow the installation guide: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

3. **Configure Docker Compose:**
   - Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and modify it to suit your needs (e.g., adding more services, changing ports).

4. **Build and Start Containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. **Access Hosted Projects:**
   - Once containers are running, you can access hosted apps via exposed ports, e.g., Flask app on `http://localhost:8080`.

6. **Load Testing (Optional):**
   - Use Apache JMeter to test the performance of your applications. Instructions are provided in the `load-testing/` folder.

### 🔧 Automated Hosting with Bash Scripts

For seamless deployment, use the provided bash script located in `scripts/`:

```bash
bash deploy.sh
```

This script will:

- Pull Docker images.
- Set configurations.
- Start containers for hosting projects.

### 🖥️ Virtual Machine Setup

If you're using Virtual Machines, ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on each VM. Use Docker Swarm to manage containers across these VMs.

## ⚙️ Example Usage

Deploy a **Flask** app and a **Node.js** app with the following `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  flask-app:
    image: flask-app-image
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    networks:
      - project-network
  node-app:
    image: node-app-image
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    networks:
      - project-network

networks:
  project-network:
    driver: bridge
```

## 🏋️‍♂️ Load Testing with Apache JMeter

1. Install **Apache JMeter** from [JMeter Downloads](https://jmeter.apache.org/).
2. Create a test plan in JMeter to simulate traffic to your apps (Flask, Node.js).
3. Run the test and analyze the performance metrics.
